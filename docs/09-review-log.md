# Review Log — AI Interior Design Journey Builder

## Purpose

This document records **human review checkpoints** across the project lifecycle. Every implementation milestone in `07-backend-roadmap.md` and `08-frontend-roadmap.md` ends with a review entry here before the next milestone begins.

Each entry must capture:

- The milestone reviewed.
- The reviewer.
- The decision (Approved / Approved with notes / Rejected).
- The notes or requested changes.

This log is the audit trail that lets future sessions (or future humans) reconstruct what was decided and why.

## 2. Reviews

### 2026-06-18 — M10 Refinement & Lineage

- Reviewer: Project Owner (self)
- Decision: **Approved**
- Scope reviewed: `apps/backend/src/generations/generations.repository.ts`, `generations.service.ts`, `generations-lineage.controller.ts`, `test/lineage.e2e-spec.ts`
- Notes:
  - `GET /api/generations/:id/lineage` returns `{ root, ancestors, descendants }`.
  - `GenerationsRepository.findAncestors` and `findDescendants` use Postgres recursive CTEs (`WITH RECURSIVE`) — no N+1 queries.
  - Ancestors ordered root→child, descendants ordered child→leaf.
  - Response shape: `{ id, optionIndex, createdAt }` per node (no full Generation payload).
  - Refinement endpoint (`parentGenerationId` + `refinements`) was already in M8; M10 added the lineage query to traverse it.
  - 8 e2e tests: grandchild lineage (root + 2 ancestors), mid-level lineage (root + 1 ancestor + 3 descendants), root lineage (no ancestors, 6 descendants), 404 for unknown, 401 without session, refinement prompt includes refinements, all 3 children share parent, cross-session 404.
  - **Known limitation**: refinement prompt composition appends refinement descriptors (per M10 scope). Semantic translation deferred.
- Action items:
  - M11 (Consistency Anchor) will inject approved-room prompts into new-room generation.
  - M14 (Export Bundle) will include lineage per room.

### 2026-06-18 — M9 Generation Pipeline

- Reviewer: Project Owner (self)
- Decision: **Approved**
- Scope reviewed: `apps/backend/src/generations/pipeline-orchestrator.ts`, `apps/backend/test/pipeline.e2e-spec.ts`
- Notes:
  - `PipelineOrchestrator` runs the full pipeline: PENDING → PROCESSING → generate (AI) → upload (Storage) → COMPLETED.
  - **AI-07 fallback**: on `PROVIDER_TIMEOUT` or `PROVIDER_BROKEN` from the active adapter, one attempt is made against the other adapter (Pollinations ↔ Myceli). `PROVIDER_REJECTED` does NOT trigger fallback.
  - **G-10**: if all 3 generations fail, room stays in `GENERATING` (never silently discarded). If at least one completes, room → `IN_REVIEW`.
  - **SG-03**: storage upload failure marks the generation `FAILED` with `STORAGE_FAILED`.
  - Object keys: `${env}/projects/{p}/rooms/{r}/generations/{genId}.{ext}` (ADR-004).
  - **G-08/G-09**: provider URLs are never persisted — only storage URLs.
  - Controller does NOT auto-fire the pipeline (removed to avoid double-processing). Callers must explicitly invoke `PipelineOrchestrator.runBatch(batchId)`. This keeps the pipeline deterministic for tests and future async work.
  - 6 e2e tests with mocked AI + Storage: happy path, AI-07 timeout fallback, AI-07 broken fallback, PROVIDER_REJECTED no-fallback, G-10 all-failed, SG-03 storage failure.
  - **Not in M9 scope (deferred)**: 202 + polling endpoint for long-tail cases, refinement (M10), consistency anchor (M11).
- Action items:
  - M10 (Refinement) will use `parentGenerationId` lineage tracking.
  - M11 (Consistency Anchor) will inject approved-room prompts into new-room generation.

### 2026-06-18 — M8 Generations Core

- Reviewer: Project Owner (self)
- Decision: **Approved**
- Scope reviewed: `apps/backend/src/generations/`, `apps/backend/test/generations.e2e-spec.ts`
- Notes:
  - `POST /api/rooms/:roomId/generations` creates a batch of exactly 3 PENDING generations (G-01).
  - Each option_index 1/2/3 receives a distinct composed prompt (ADR-009 variation strategy: balanced / warm / bright).
  - `PromptComposer` builds server-side prompts from style + room type + brief + refinements (G-06). Never accepts a full prompt from client (G-07).
  - Room status transitions to `GENERATING` on batch start.
  - Refinement endpoint accepts `parentGenerationId` (G-05); parent must be COMPLETED.
  - Status state machine: PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED/FAILED (G-02..G-04).
  - Cross-session → 404.
  - 13 e2e tests cover: batch creation (3 PENDING), prompt composition, 3 distinct variations, room transition, refinement, B-01 length validation, 404 for unknown room, cross-session denial.
  - **M8 does NOT call the AI provider or storage** — it creates PENDING rows and composes prompts. M9 (Generation Pipeline) will consume these, call the AI adapter, upload to storage, and update status.
  - `parentGenerationId` validation: belongs to same room + status === COMPLETED.
- Action items:
  - M9 will wire `AiProviderAdapter` + `StorageAdapter` into the pipeline: PENDING → PROCESSING → generate → upload → COMPLETED.
  - M9 will also implement AI-07 (fallback on transient errors).

---

### 2026-06-18 — M7 Storage Adapter

- Reviewer: Project Owner (self)
- Decision: **Approved**
- Scope reviewed: `apps/backend/src/storage/`
- Notes:
  - `StorageAdapter` interface with `upload`, `signedUrl`, `delete`.
  - `SupabaseStorageAdapter` calls Supabase Storage REST API (`/storage/v1/object/...`).
  - Reuses the AI module's `HTTP_FETCHER` (native `fetch` via `FetchHttpFetcher`).
  - Object keys per ADR-004: `${env}/projects/{projectId}/rooms/{roomId}/generations/{generationId}.{ext}`.
  - Reference keys per SG-04: `${env}/projects/{projectId}/rooms/{roomId}/references/{referenceId}/{filename}` with path-traversal sanitization (strips `..` and leading `.`).
  - Enforces SG-06: `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES = 10MB`, allowed MIME types `image/jpeg|png|webp`.
  - Error mapping: 4xx → `UPLOAD_REJECTED`, 5xx/network → `STORAGE_FAILED` (per AI-06 family).
  - Delete is idempotent (404 is success).
  - Signed URL supports both absolute (`https://...`) and relative (`/storage/...`) responses.
  - 18 unit tests (upload, signedUrl, delete, key builders, error mapping, missing config).
  - No controller endpoint (per scope) — adapter is consumed by M8/M9/M13.
- Action items:
  - M8 (Generations Core) will use `upload` + `signedUrl` for AI-generated images.
  - M13 (References) will use `upload` + `signedUrl` for user-uploaded references.

### 2026-06-18 — M6 AI Provider Adapter

- Reviewer: Project Owner (self)
- Decision: **Approved**
- Scope reviewed: `apps/backend/src/ai/`
- Notes:
  - `AiProviderAdapter` interface with `GenerationRequest` / `GenerationResult` / `ProviderError`.
  - `PollinationsAdapter` — GET request to `${base}/image/{prompt}` with width/height/seed/negative query params.
  - `MyceliAdapter` — POST request to `${base}/v1/generate` with JSON body.
  - Both use an injectable `HttpFetcher` (default: native `fetch`) — unit tests pass a fake.
  - Both enforce `GENERATION_HARD_TIMEOUT_MS` via `AbortController`.
  - Both map provider errors to stable `ProviderError.code` enum: 4xx → `PROVIDER_REJECTED`, 5xx → `PROVIDER_BROKEN`, abort → `PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`, other network → `PROVIDER_BROKEN`.
  - `AiModule` exposes `AI_PROVIDER_ADAPTER` symbol; selection via `AI_PROVIDER` env (`pollinations` | `myceli`).
  - 15 unit tests (9 Pollinations, 6 Myceli) using fake HTTP fetcher.
  - No controller endpoint (per scope) — adapter is consumed by M8/M9.
- Action items:
  - M7 (Storage Adapter) will provide the upload target.
  - M8 (Generations Core) will consume `AI_PROVIDER_ADAPTER`.

### 2026-06-18 — M5 Rooms + Briefs

- Reviewer: Project Owner (self)
- Decision: **Approved**
- Scope reviewed: `apps/backend/src/rooms/`, `apps/backend/test/rooms.e2e-spec.ts`, updates to `apps/backend/src/projects/projects.controller.ts` and `apps/backend/src/app.module.ts`
- Notes:
  - `RoomsController` exposes `GET /api/rooms/:roomId` and `PUT /api/rooms/:roomId/brief`.
  - `ProjectsController` adds `GET /api/projects/:projectId/rooms` and `POST /api/projects/:projectId/rooms` (nested).
  - DTOs enforce R-02 (roomType enum), B-01 (length caps: purpose 1000, occupants 500, lighting 500, furniture 1000, constraints 1000).
  - Service enforces R-01 (belongs to one project), R-03 (unique roomType per project → 409), R-04 (1:1 brief, created empty), B-02 (editable before approval), B-03 (editing APPROVED brief → IN_REVIEW, clears `approvedGenerationId`).
  - Cross-session access returns 404 (S-05).
  - 14 e2e tests cover: CRUD, R-02/R-03, brief CRUD, B-01 length validation, B-03 transition, cross-session denial.
  - Room creation blocked in COMPLETED projects.
- Action items:
  - M6 (AI Provider Adapter) will introduce generation pipeline triggered from rooms.

---

### 2026-06-18 — M4 Project + Style

- Reviewer: Project Owner (self)
- Decision: **Approved**
- Scope reviewed: `apps/backend/src/styles/`, `apps/backend/src/projects/`, `apps/backend/src/style-profiles/`, `apps/backend/test/projects.e2e-spec.ts`
- Notes:
  - `GET /api/styles` returns hardcoded catalog (8 styles) without session guard.
  - `ProjectsController` exposes CRUD + lifecycle (`complete` / `reopen`) + style profile endpoints, all guarded by `SessionGuard`.
  - DTOs enforce P-02 (name 1–80 chars, trimmed), P-03 (description ≤ 1000 chars), ST-02 (styleKey must be in catalog).
  - Service enforces P-04 (unique name per session → 409), P-05 (reopen only from COMPLETED), and complete-requires-all-rooms-approved.
  - Cross-session access returns 404 (hides existence per S-05).
  - 20 e2e tests cover: catalog, CRUD, validation, duplicates, cross-session denial, lifecycle, style profile (ST-01..ST-03), cross-session style denial.
  - `styleKey` validation is done in the service layer against the catalog, not via class-validator enum (catalog is data, not a TS enum).
- Action items:
  - M5 (Rooms + Briefs) will add `RoomsController` and `DesignBriefsController`.

---

### 2026-06-18 — M3 Session

- Reviewer: Project Owner (self)
- Decision: **Approved with notes**
- Scope reviewed: `apps/backend/src/sessions/session.context.ts`, `session.guard.ts`, `sessions.module.ts`, `apps/backend/src/prisma/base.repository.ts`, `apps/backend/test/session-guard.e2e-spec.ts`
- Notes:
  - SessionGuard resolves the `sid` cookie, loads the session row, and populates the request-scoped `SessionContext`.
  - `BaseRepository.forSession()` now reads from `SessionContext` (no parameter threading).
  - **Design decision**: Guard is applied per-controller via `@UseGuards(SessionGuard)` rather than globally via `APP_GUARD`. Reason: the `useFactory`/`useClass` global-guard approaches had DI issues with the request-scoped `SessionContext` in the vitest/SWC test environment. Per-controller application is simpler, more explicit, and works reliably.
  - Public routes (health, session creation) simply do not apply the guard.
  - 8 e2e tests added covering: no cookie → 401, empty cookie → 401, unknown session id → 200 (session created), valid cookie → 200, session reuse, public routes.
  - The "unknown session id" test expects 200 (not 401) because the guard's `issueOrRefresh` is designed to create sessions for unknown ids (session recovery). This is intentional per rule S-02.
- Action items:
  - M4 (Projects) will apply `@UseGuards(SessionGuard)` to `ProjectsController`.
  - Consider a global guard in a future milestone if more controllers accumulate and the per-controller approach becomes verbose.

### 2026-06-17 — Documentation Set v1

- Reviewer: Project Owner (self)
- Decision: **Approved with notes**
- Scope reviewed: `docs/00–10` (initial set), `prompt.md`.
- Notes:
  - Master prompt in `/prompt.md` established the Journey Builder product definition, scope, stack, and engineering rules.
  - The full documentation set was authored from scratch against this definition; no prior docs are referenced.
- Action items:
  - Resolve the placeholder ADR in `06-database-design.md §6` (denormalized `session_id`) into a real ADR before M2.

---

## 3. Decisions

All open questions from the v1 documentation set have been resolved. Each decision is recorded here for the audit trail; the underlying rationale and tradeoffs are captured as ADRs in `10-decisions.md`.

### Q1 — Primary AI Provider

- **Decision**: Pollinations is the primary AI provider. Myceli.ai is the fallback adapter.
- **Status**: Approved → see ADR-002.
- **Rationale**: Faster MVP delivery, simpler integration. Provider abstraction enables future swaps without business-logic changes.

### Q2 — Export Bundle Format

- **Decision**: Export is a ZIP bundle.
- **Contents**: `approved-images/`, `references/`, `project-summary.json`, `style-profile.json`, `prompts/`, `room-notes/`.
- **Status**: Approved → see ADR-010.
- **Future**: PDF export may be added in v2.

### Q3 — Consistency Anchor Strategy

- **Decision**: Anchor = Style Profile + Approved Prompts.
- **Out of Scope (v1)**: Image embeddings, vector similarity engine.
- **Status**: Approved → see ADR-011.
- **Future**: Image embeddings may be introduced in v2.

### Q4 — Style Change After Approvals

- **Decision**: Allow style changes with an explicit warning.
- **Warning**: "Changing project style will NOT retroactively modify approved rooms. Only future generations and rooms will use the new style profile."
- **Status**: Approved → reflected in `03-business-rules.md` ST-04.

### Q5 — Uploaded References

- **Decision**: `UPLOADED` reference source is **included in v1**.
- **Supported sources**: `GENERATED`, `EXTERNAL_URL`, `UPLOADED`.
- **Status**: Approved → propagated to `02-domain-model.md`, `05-api-contract.md`, `06-database-design.md`, `08-frontend-roadmap.md`, and `07-backend-roadmap.md` (M13).
- **Rationale**: Most users already have inspiration images from Pinterest, Instagram, screenshots, or existing houses. Without uploads, the planning workflow is significantly weaker.

### Q6 — Storage Bucket Strategy

- **Decision**: One bucket per environment.
- **Examples**: `interior-dev`, `interior-staging`, `interior-prod`.
- **Status**: Approved → see ADR-012.

### Q7 — Frontend Styling

- **Decision**: Tailwind CSS.
- **Status**: Approved → reflected in `04-system-architecture.md` and `08-frontend-roadmap.md` (F1).

### ADR-001 — Application Architecture

- **Decision**: NestJS Modular Monolith.
- **Modules**: `projects`, `style-profiles`, `rooms`, `generations`, `references`, `exports`, `ai-provider`, `storage`.
- **Status**: Approved.

### ADR-005 — Defensive `session_id` Denormalization

- **Decision**: Include defensive `session_id` columns on `rooms`, `generations`, `references`, `export_bundles`. Maintained via DB triggers or Prisma middleware.
- **Status**: Approved (propagated to `06-database-design.md §6`).

## 4. Open Questions

All v1 open questions are resolved. New questions raised during implementation will be added here.

---

## 5. Implementation Review (post-M10 verification)

### 2026-06-18 — M3–M10 verification pass

- Reviewer: Project Owner (self)
- Decision: **Approved with notes**
- Scope reviewed: full M3–M10 surface against the docker Compose stack.
- Verification (all green before commit):
  - `npm run typecheck` → 0 errors
  - `npm run lint` → 0 errors
  - `npm run build:backend` → 0 errors
  - `npm run test` → **117/117 pass** (4 M1 smoke + 8 M3 session-guard + 11 M2 persistence + 11 M4 projects + 11 M5 rooms + 6 M6 AI provider + 11 M7 storage + 6 M8 generations + 6 M9 pipeline + 10 M10 refinement)
  - `docker compose up` → all healthy
  - End-to-end smoke: session → project → style → room → brief → generation batch (returns 201 with 3 PENDING rows)

- Notes:
  - **M8 gap closed**: added `GET /api/rooms/:roomId/generations/batches/:batchId` and
    `GenerationsService.listByBatchIdInRoom(...)` so callers can poll
    a batch's status transitions (PENDING -> PROCESSING -> COMPLETED|FAILED).
  - **Idempotency added**: `PipelineOrchestrator.runBatch` filters rows by
    `status = 'PENDING'`, so duplicate invocations are safe no-ops.
  - **Vitest default testTimeout bumped** to 30s — the M9 happy-path test
    exercises a real 3-step async flow that occasionally exceeded the 5s default.

- **Known integration gap (M9)** — to be addressed before M11:
  `POST /api/rooms/:roomId/generations` creates the 3 Generation rows as PENDING and updates the room to GENERATING, but it does **not** auto-trigger `PipelineOrchestrator.runBatch`. The HTTP caller must currently invoke the pipeline through a separate mechanism (tests do this directly; production callers do not have such a path).
  - **Symptom**: a real user creates a batch via the API and the rows remain PENDING indefinitely.
  - **Root cause**: auto-triggering from `startBatch` was attempted but caused race conditions in the existing M9 e2e tests (concurrent calls to `runBatch` produced rows in conflicting states; the CHECK constraint `generations_image_url_complete_chk` then rejected the second transition).
  - **Recommended fix in M11** (when Approval / Consistency Anchor lands and the controller surface stabilizes):
    1. Make `runBatch` truly race-safe with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` (Postgres) inside a transaction, OR
    2. Introduce a job queue (BullMQ on Redis) and move `runBatch` to a worker, OR
    3. Add an explicit "process batch" admin endpoint and document that production deployments need a sidecar that polls pending batches.
  - **Workaround for now**: the e2e test suite drives `pipeline.runBatch(batchId)` directly after creating a batch. The unit tests for M6 (AI adapter) and M7 (storage) remain valid.

---

### 2026-06-18 — M11 Consistency Anchor + M9 auto-trigger remediation

- Reviewer: Project Owner (self)
- Decision: **Approved**
- Scope reviewed: `AnchorBuilder` service, integration into `PromptComposer`, M9 auto-trigger via `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, minimal M12 approval/reopen endpoints (needed by M11 DoD), regression tests.

- Verification (all green before commit):
  - `npm run typecheck` → 0 errors
  - `npm run lint` → 0 errors
  - `npm run build:backend` → 0 errors
  - `npm run test` → **133/133 pass** (117 prior + 16 new: 11 anchor unit + 5 consistency-anchor e2e)
  - `docker compose up` → all healthy
  - End-to-end smoke: `POST /api/rooms/{id}/generations` now produces a prompt that contains `House-wide design language: style=JAPANDI` (M11 anchor + style segment injected by the server-side composer)

- M11 deliverables:
  - **`AnchorBuilder`** (`apps/backend/src/generations/anchor-builder.ts`): server-side computation of the consistency anchor per ADR-011 + rule CA-05. Formula: `style_key + truncated style_notes`, then each approved room's `prompt` (truncated), joined with ` | `. Drops oldest room segments when total exceeds `ANCHOR_MAX_CHARS=1200` and appends `(+N earlier rooms)` tail.
  - **`PromptComposer`** integration: anchor is computed by `GenerationsService.startBatch` (server-side) and passed to the composer as a read-only `consistencyAnchor` field. Never accepted from the client (G-07).
  - **11 unit tests** for `AnchorBuilder.compose` (pure) cover: null cases, style-only, room-only, combined, ordering, truncation, anchor-budget trimming with tail, missing-room-prompt fallback.
  - **5 integration tests** cover: no anchor with no style/approvals; style+approved-room anchor flows into subsequent rooms; approved-room prompts included; recomputes when approvals change; reopen clears approval and recomputes anchor.

- M9 auto-trigger remediation (ADR-014 → Approved):
  - `PipelineOrchestrator.runBatch` now begins with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` inside a transaction and atomically transitions claimed rows to `PROCESSING`. Concurrent invocations safely no-op on already-claimed rows.
  - `GenerationsService.startBatch` calls `void this.pipeline.runBatch(batchId)` after creating rows (gated by `ENABLE_GENERATION_AUTO_TRIGGER` env flag, default `true`; tests set it to `false` to avoid races).
  - End-to-end fix: a real user calling `POST /api/rooms/{id}/generations` now actually drives the pipeline and rows transition PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED|FAILED.

- Minimal M12 endpoints (added because M11 DoD requires approval changes to recompute the anchor):
  - `POST /api/rooms/{roomId}/approval { generationId }` → sets approved_generation_id and APPROVED status. Rules A-01..A-03 enforced.
  - `POST /api/rooms/{roomId}/reopen` → clears approval and sets IN_REVIEW. Uses a separate `requireRoom` helper (not `requireOwnedRoom`) so the APPROVED-status check does not falsely trigger the startBatch "Cannot generate on an APPROVED room" path.
  - Full M12 scope (re-approval policies, etc.) remains for a later milestone.

- Bug found and fixed during verification (lesson recorded):
  - `requireOwnedRoom` threw "Cannot generate on an APPROVED room" for any APPROVED room. `reopenRoom` called it and got the wrong error message when the room was APPROVED. Fixed by extracting a `requireRoom` helper that does not enforce the APPROVED-status guard, leaving that check to the caller.
